<h1>My Dearest Manoj ❤️</h1>

<div class="book">

<div class="page"><p>Our story didn’t begin like a movie…<br><br>
It began quietly, during the world’s pause — Corona, 2019.<br>
When the world slowed down, somehow… my heart started noticing you.<br><br>

We came to grandmother’s home for those long corona holidays —<br>
You with your 10th boards, me with my 12th.<br>
Back then, I never imagined you would become my world.<br>
You were just my cousin… someone around me… nothing more.</p></div>
<div class="page"><p>But love is strange… it arrives softly, without warning.<br><br>

One simple evening, when we went out for gobi manchuri,<br>
I told you I liked your hairstyle…<br>
and maybe you didn’t know —<br>
that tiny moment was the first time my heart saw you differently.<br><br>

And maybe… something changed in you too.<br>
You never said it immediately, but later you told me —<br>
one quiet night, when we were close without words,<br>
you kissed me softly… and from that moment,<br>
a strange feeling stayed in your heart.<br>
It began with guilt… but slowly, quietly,<br>
that feeling turned into love.</p></div>
<div class="page"><p>Then came our sihi shavige day ❤️<br>
I was preparing, you sat next to me casually…<br>
and asked, “Do you have a boyfriend?”<br>
I said no.<br><br>

Then you asked me to ask you the same.<br>
When I asked… you smiled and said —<br>
“Yes… she is sitting next to me.”<br><br>

That moment… my heart already knew.<br>
But hearing it from you made everything real.<br><br>

Corona ended… we returned home…<br>
but our story had already begun.<br><br>

One day, without fear, without waiting,<br>
you said “I love you.”<br>
And without thinking twice…<br>
I said “I love you too.”</p></div>
<div class="page"><p>No drama. No long wait.<br>
Just two hearts… choosing each other.<br><br>

Even though distance exists between us…<br>
it never truly felt like distance.<br>
Just two hours apart — yet always close in heart.<br><br>

Every time we meet becomes my sweetest memory.<br>
But one day will always stay special — our very first meet.<br><br>

We met at Majestic… simple, nervous, quiet… yet beautiful.<br>
From there, we went to the temple — maybe to thank destiny.<br>
Then we watched Bhajarangi 2 in that small ₹150 theatre…<br>
It wasn’t about the movie… it was about us.</p></div>
<div class="page"><p>Our first real moment together — and my heart still remembers every second of that day.<br><br>

And every time we had to say goodbye… those were the hardest moments.<br>
Smiling while leaving… but crying inside.<br>
Whenever I returned home after meeting you,<br>
tears followed — not from sadness, but because leaving you felt heavy.<br><br>

But one memory stays deeper than all…<br><br>

When I was doing my internship near your house,<br>
those three months felt like a beautiful dream — seeing you often, feeling close, feeling complete.<br>
And the day I had to leave…<br><br>

You cried.<br>
I cried.<br><br>

No words. Just two hearts not wanting to separate.<br><br>

That moment made me realize — this is not just love… this is home.</p></div>
<div class="page"><p><b>Through sweet memories, silly fights, laughter, tears, and a thousand little moments…<br>
we built our love.<br><br>

You are not just my love, Manoj…<br>
You are my peace. My comfort. My safe place.<br>
The person who made ordinary days feel magical.<br><br>

And today, if someone asks me what love means…<br>
I will simply say — You.<br><br>

No matter where life takes us,<br>
no matter how many storms come,<br>
my heart will always choose you.<br><br>

<b>Forever yours ❤️</b></b></p></div>
